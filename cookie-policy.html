          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>This page explains how Leckerbissen uses cookies on our website. We are committed to transparency and protecting your privacy.</p>

          <h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
          <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.</p>

          <h3>Our Use of Cookies</h3>
          <p>This website uses only essential cookies. These are sometimes referred to as "strictly necessary" cookies.</p>
          <p>Essential cookies are necessary for the website to function correctly and cannot be switched off in our systems. They do not store any personally identifiable information and do not track your browsing activity. Under the UK's data protection laws (including UK GDPR and PECR), we are not required to obtain your consent to place essential cookies on your device, but we must inform you about their use.</p>
          
          <h3>Why We Use Essential Cookies</h3>
          <p>The essential cookies used on this website are for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Basic Website Functionality:</strong> Ensuring the website loads correctly and navigates properly.</li>
              <li><strong>Cookie Consent Preference:</strong> Remembering whether you have dismissed the cookie information banner. We use local storage (similar technology to cookies) for this purpose, specifically an item called `cookieConsent`. This ensures you are not repeatedly shown the banner on subsequent visits.</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>No Tracking or Analytics Cookies Used</h3>
          <p>We want to assure you that we do not use any cookies for analytics, performance tracking, advertising, or targeting purposes. We do not track your activity across other websites or build profiles about you.</p>

          <h3>Managing Cookies</h3>
          <p>While you cannot opt-out of essential cookies via our website (as they are necessary for it to work), most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. You can usually find these settings in the 'Options' or 'Preferences' menu of your browser.</p>
          <p>To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.aboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
          <p>Please be aware that restricting or deleting cookies may impact the functionality of this website.</p>

          <h3>Changes to This Cookie Policy</h3>
          <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes. The effective date at the top indicates the last revision.</p>
